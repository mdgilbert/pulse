### To install

To clone the Pulse, open a terminal and type

  * git clone https://github.com/mdgilbert/pulse

This will create a new directory, 'pulse', in your current directory and copy
all files into that directory.  You're now ready to start coding!

### To setup

Once you have the project files, you'll still need to setup the database 
credentials.  To do this, create a new file called .my.wikiproj.cnf in 
the pulse directory.  That file should have the following contents:

[client]
uw_host = <db host>
uw_port = <db port>
uw_user = <db user>
uw_password = <db password>

If you need access to the DB, contact the project owner.

### To view

Just point your web server to serve from the pulse directory, and visit the local
URL, probably something like http://localhost/pulse.
